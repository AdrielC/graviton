# Protocol Stack

The protocol modules expose Gravitonâ€™s functionality over HTTP, gRPC, and shared JSON models. They sit on top of the runtime ports and can be consumed by the Scala.js frontend, CLI clients, or external integrations.

| Module | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protocol/graviton-shared` | Cross-platform data models (`ApiModels`) and a minimal `HttpClient` interface used by Scala.js. | JSON codecs derive from zio-json so they can compile to both JVM and JS targets. |
| `protocol/graviton-proto` | Protobuf contracts for the gRPC services. | The `.proto` files live under `src/main/protobuf/graviton`; code generation is handled via sbt. |
| `protocol/graviton-grpc` | Skeleton service implementations for blob ingest, retrieval, and admin endpoints. | Wrap the runtime `BlobStore` and return placeholder responses where business logic is pending. |
| `protocol/graviton-http` | zio-http routes and JSON codecs for REST-style access. | Current handlers respond with `Response.text("ok")`; authentication middleware is a no-op stub. |

## Shared models (`graviton-shared`)

- `ApiModels` contains the types exchanged between the frontend and HTTP API: blob metadata, manifests, health responses, and upload requests.
- `HttpClient` defines the minimal HTTP surface needed by Scala.js. `BrowserHttpClient` in the frontend implements it using the Fetch API.

## gRPC services (`graviton-grpc`)

- `BlobServiceImpl` and `UploadServiceImpl` delegate directly to a `BlobStore`. Upload currently streams chunks into `blobStore.put`; additional validation (hashing, manifests) will be added.
- `AdminServiceImpl` exposes a simple `health` call returning a static status string.
- Generated service interfaces from `graviton-proto` will wrap these implementations once the wiring is complete in `graviton-server`.

## HTTP surface (`graviton-http`)

- `HttpApi` constructs a zio-http `Handler` graph. At the moment it replies with `Response.text("ok")`; route composition and request decoding are still TODO.
- `AuthMiddleware.optional` is a placeholder that simply returns the wrapped handler. Replace it with token validation once authn/authz is designed.
- `JsonCodecs` demonstrates how zio-schema will be leveraged for automatic schema derivation and request validation.

## Protocol roadmap

1. Finalise the `.proto` definitions and generate strongly-typed Scala services with zio-grpc.
2. Replace HTTP stubs with proper routing, JSON encoders/decoders, and error handling.
3. Add acceptance tests that exercise both HTTP and gRPC transports against in-memory backends.
4. Document versioning and backwards compatibility guarantees for public API shapes.
