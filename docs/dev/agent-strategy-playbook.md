# Agent Strategy Playbook (Sicko Mode)

This playbook is a deep, step-by-step execution guide for aligning Graviton with ZIO Streams best practices, Iron refined types, and consistent coding standards.
It is intentionally exhaustive so agents can follow a deterministic checklist without ambiguity.

## How to Use This Playbook
1. Read the section headers to locate the relevant workflow.
2. Execute the steps in order, marking checkboxes in your working notes.
3. Use the templates for design notes, reviews, and refactoring plans.
4. Record execution outcomes in the repository change log or task trackers.
