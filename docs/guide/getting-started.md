# Getting Started

Welcome to Graviton ‚Äî a modular, content-addressable storage runtime built on ZIO.

## What is Graviton?

Graviton provides a stable ingest and retrieval pipeline for large binary payloads. The system is designed with modularity at its core, allowing hashing, chunking, persistence, replication, and protocol concerns to evolve independently.

## Key Features

- **Content-Addressable Storage**: Automatic deduplication through content-defined chunking
- **Modular Architecture**: Pure domain logic separated from effectful runtime code
- **Multiple Backends**: S3, PostgreSQL, RocksDB support out of the box
- **ZIO-Powered**: Built on ZIO for composable, type-safe effects
- **Protocol Flexibility**: Both gRPC and HTTP endpoints
- **Observable**: Prometheus metrics, structured logging, and tracing

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- sbt 1.11+
- Node.js 20+ (for documentation and the interactive demo)
- Docker (optional, for TestContainers-driven integration tests)

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AdrielC/graviton.git
cd graviton

# Compile all modules
sbt compile

# Run formatting + the full JVM/JVM JS test matrix (without TestContainers)
TESTCONTAINERS=0 ./sbt scalafmtAll test

# (Optional) Exercise container-backed integration tests
TESTCONTAINERS=1 ./sbt test
```

### Run the Documentation & Live Demo

The documentation site embeds the Scala.js dashboard that powers the interactive storage demo. Build the JS bundle before launching VitePress so the `/demo` page can load it without console errors.

```bash
# From the project root
./sbt buildFrontend       # copies Scala.js output into docs/public/js/

cd docs
npm install               # first run only
npm run docs:dev
```

Once VitePress boots at `http://localhost:5173`, open the **üéÆ Demo** tab and confirm you can navigate between Dashboard, Explorer, Upload, and Stats without the page reloading. If you deploy the docs somewhere with a sub-path (for example GitHub Pages), the loader picks up the correct base URL automatically‚Äîno manual tweaks required.

::: tip No Scala.js bundle?
If the demo reports _‚ÄúInteractive Demo Not Available‚Äù_, rebuild it with `./sbt buildFrontend` and refresh the page. The bundle is committed for convenience, but rebuilding ensures it tracks your local Scala sources.

## Your First Upload

Here's a minimal example of using Graviton's core APIs:

```scala
import graviton.core.*
import graviton.runtime.*
import zio.*

// Create a simple blob store
val store: BlobStore = ???

// Upload some bytes
val upload = for {
  // Compute hash and derive key
  bytes <- ZIO.succeed("Hello, Graviton!".getBytes)
  key   <- HashAlgo.SHA256.hash(bytes)
  
  // Store the blob
  _ <- store.put(key, Chunk.fromArray(bytes))
  
  // Retrieve it back
  retrieved <- store.get(key)
} yield retrieved

// Run the effect
Unsafe.unsafe { implicit unsafe =>
  Runtime.default.unsafe.run(upload)
}
```
