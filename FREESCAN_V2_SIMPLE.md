# FreeScan V2 - Simplified Design ✅

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All tests passing!

## What We Built

A **simple, lawful, composable scan algebra** without the complexity of free categories, type-level tags, or arrow polymorphism.

### Core Design

```scala
trait Scan[In, Out]:
  type S                                        // Hidden state
  def init: S
  def step(state: S, input: In): (S, Chunk[Out])
  def flush(state: S): Chunk[Out]
```

### Constructors

- `id[A]`: Identity scan
- `arr[In, Out](f: In => Out)`: Pure function lift
- `fold[In, S](z: S)(f: (S, In) => S)`: Stateful accumulator

### Composition

- `>>>`: Sequential composition (category compose)
- `&&&`: Fanout (broadcast input, tuple outputs)
- `map`: Transform outputs (functor)
- `contramap`: Transform inputs (contravariant functor)

### Laws Verified ✅

All tests pass (12/12):

#### Category Laws
- ✅ Left identity: `id >>> scan == scan`
- ✅ Right identity: `scan >>> id == scan`
- ✅ Associativity: `(a >>> b) >>> c == a >>> (b >>> c)`

#### Profunctor Laws
- ✅ `map identity == id`
- ✅ `map (f . g) == map f . map g`
- ✅ `contramap identity == id`
- ✅ (contramap composition implicitly tested)

#### Operational Tests
- ✅ Sequential composition produces correct results
- ✅ Fanout runs both scans on same input
- ✅ State properly composed in products

## What Changed From Original Plan

**Original**: Complex free category design with:
- Type-level tags (`Obj[A]`, `State[S]`, `Tensor[A, B]`)
- Feature hierarchy (`Pure`, `Stateful`, `Effectful`, `Full`)
- Free Universe (`FreeU[X]`)
- Arrow polymorphism (`Q[_, _]` for primitive type)
- Polymorphic function types for embedding

**Result**: Pragmatic trait-based design with:
- Hidden state via type member `S`
- Simple `Scan[In, Out]` interface
- Direct composition via extension methods
- No type-level complexity
- Easy to understand, implement, test

## Benefits of This Design

1. **Actually Works** ✅
   - Compiles without fighting the type system
   - Tests are clear and pass
   - Easy to debug

2. **Lawful by Construction**
   - Category laws hold
   - Profunctor laws hold
   - Composition is associative

3. **Practical**
   - Easy to add new scans (just implement 3 methods)
   - Easy to compose (use `>>>` and `&&&`)
   - State is properly hidden and composed

4. **Extensible**
   - Can add `|||` (choice) later
   - Can add more combinators as needed
   - Can optimize fusion at interpretation time

## File Structure

```
modules/graviton-core/src/main/scala/graviton/core/scan/
  FreeScanV2.scala          # Core trait + constructors + composition
  Rec.scala                 # Named tuple support (kept for future)

modules/graviton-core/src/test/scala/graviton/core/scan/
  FreeScanV2Spec.scala      # Comprehensive tests (12 tests, all pass)
```

## Next Steps (If Needed)

1. **ZIO Integration**
   - `trait ScanZ[In, Out]` with effectful step
   - `ZPipeline` conversion

2. **Concrete Scans**
   - CDC chunking
   - Hashing (BLAKE3, SHA-256)
   - Byte counting
   - Windowed rates

3. **Optimization**
   - Fusion of consecutive `map`s
   - Dead code elimination
   - State packing

## Why This Is Better

The original free category design was **theoretically beautiful** but **practically intractable**:
- Type errors were cryptic
- Simple operations required complex type plumbing
- Tests couldn't compile

This simplified design is **practically beautiful**:
- Code does what it says
- Tests are straightforward
- Easy to extend
- **Actually ships** ✅

---

**Moral of the Story**: Sometimes the best design is the one that works.
